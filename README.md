This is a face detection model for high-precision facial localization based on [RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00641). This model accurately detects facial landmarks and bounding boxes for faces in images. This repository provides custom training & inference code, and several new backbone models have been integrated for improved performance and flexibility.

> [!NOTE]  
> We've updated the codebase with new trained models and a refactored structure, enhancing functionality and maintainability. These improvements include support for MobileNetV1 (including v1_025 and v1_050), MobileNetV2, and various ResNet versions (18, 34, 50), offering a cleaner and more reproducible experience.

## 🧪 Evaluating RetinaFace on WiderFace Dataset

### 1. Get and Install WiderFace Evaluation Tool

1. Clone the WiderFace evaluation repository inside the `retinaface-pytorch` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yakhyo/widerface_evaluation
   ```
2. Navigate to the `widerface_evaluation` folder and build the required extension:
   ```bash
   cd widerface_evaluation
   python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
   ```
3. Return to the `retinaface-pytorch` folder after installation is complete:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

### 2. Generate Predictions

Run the following command to evaluate your RetinaFace model with WiderFace, specifying the model architecture (`mobilenetv1` in this example) and the path to the trained weights. Predictions will be stored in `widerface_txt` inside the `widerface_evaluation` folder.

```bash
python evaluate_widerface.py --network mobilenetv1 --weights weights/mobilenetv1.pth
```

### 3. Run the Final Evaluation

After generating predictions, navigate to the widerface_evaluation folder and run the following command to compare predictions with the ground truth annotations:

```bash
cd widerface_evaluation
python evaluation.py -p widerface_txt -g ground_truth
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Ensure `ground_truth` is the path to the WiderFace ground truth directory.

This will begin the evaluation process of your model on the WiderFace dataset.
